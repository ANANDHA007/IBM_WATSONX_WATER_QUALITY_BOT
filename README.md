# IBM_WATSONX_WATER_QUALITY_BOT
We integrated IBM WatsonX Assistant with our API via webhooks to provide real-time water quality data and insights. The assistant interprets user queries on metrics like pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature, delivering personalized, location-based reports. This enables a seamless, data-driven experience through natural language conversations.
